# 🛡️ AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning (Random Forest) along with Generative AI to detect and explain network intrusions such as DDoS attacks. The system analyzes network traffic patterns and classifies them as benign or malicious, providing explainable insights for detection results.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Enter API Key: Paste your Groq API key in the sidebar (optional, for AI-based explanations).
2. Train Model: Click the "Train AI Model" button to train the intrusion detection model.
3. Simulate: Use the simulation option to analyze network traffic samples.
4. Analyze: View whether the traffic is classified as BENIGN or DDoS along with an AI-generated explanation.

## 📁 Files

- app.py : Main Python application file.
- requirements.txt : List of required Python libraries.

> Note: Large dataset files are not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations. The code supports standard intrusion detection datasets such as CIC-IDS2017.

## ℹ️ About
